# A New Association Approach for Multi-Sensor Air Traffic Surveillance Data Based on Deep Neural Networks
This repository contains the implementation of the M-SIOTA algorithm as described in the paper “A New Association Approach for Multi-Sensor Air Traffic Surveillance Data Based on Deep Neural Networks”.

## Installation
The required packages for training and running the algorithm are in the requirements.txt file.

## Usage

To run the association algorithm, use the Jupiter notebook main_associator.ipynb. The notebook expects a .csv file in the opensky directory. The route and filename of the dataset can be changed in the default_config.json file.
The 24h State Vector from OpenSky Network file format is used.
